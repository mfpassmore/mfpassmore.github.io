      <h1>My name is Michael</h1>

      <p>I am enrolled in the Computer Programming and Development course here at Wake Tech.
         Fall of 2020 was my first semester at Wake Tech, but I recently found an interest
         in software engineering and decided to switch programs. I have always been good with
         computers and math, and I enjoy problem solving. Software engineering seems to have 
         a good mix of those things so I gravitated towards it. Not to mention you can make 
         good money in that field. For my career I intend to do something related to 
         programming/software engineering. In my program I have a lot of fun doing activities 
         that involve active learning with coding, like what we are doing with HTML. I think 
         I would really enjoy working with computers for a living. In the next 5 years I hope 
         to be done with school and working a job coding/programming. For now I am excited to 
         learn more this semester!</p>
